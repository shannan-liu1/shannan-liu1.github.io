Hello! My name is Shannan. I'm an aspiring data scientist.

I graduated from UCLA in 2022 with a B.A. in Business Economics. At UCLA, I conducted research on the relationships between market events and the returns of various securities, and I applied machine learning to generate portfolio weights and signals for algorithmic trading strategies. Meanwhile, I accelerated the growth of *International Bruins in Business*, one of UCLAs premier business clubs, where I spearheaded initiatives focused on data science and founded UCLA's leading quantitative finance community. 

 I'm currently enrolled in the Master of Business Analytics program at MIT Sloan through which I aim to deepen my knowledge of machine learning, optimization, analytics, and operations research. 
 
 I have experience in data analytics, financial analysis, business development, and sales. I'm interested in finance; logistics and supply chain analytics; and natural language processing. Upon graduation, I intend to pursue a career as a data scientist. 

On this site, I share my research and projects. You'll find work on sentiment analysis, web scraping, financial modelling,
