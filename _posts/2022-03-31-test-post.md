# Some formulas I like
Fisher Equation: relationship between real interest rates, inflation, and nominal rates
$$r = \frac{1+i}{1+\pi} - 1$$

Black-Scholes Model: value of call option at T = 0
$$C_0 = S_0 N(d_1) - Xe^{-rT}N(d_2)$$

# Some code & images
## Mapping correlations between stocks in the DJIA30
```
import seaborn as sns

df_corr = df_subset.corr()
sns.set(font_scale=.7)

mask = np.zeros_like(df_corr)
mask[np.triu_indices_from(mask)] = True
sns.heatmap(df_corr,annot=False,cmap='YlGnBu',linewidths=.2,
            cbar=True,cbar_kws={"orientation": "vertical"},
           mask = mask,vmax = 1,vmin=-1,
           square=True);
