## Introduction
In this post, I will create interactive data graphics with NOAA climate data.

## Create a database
To begin, let's create a database called "temps" that includes 3 interrelated tables: `temperatures`, `stations`, and `countries`. These tables will contain all of the relevant climate information for us to create interesting interactive data graphics moving forward.

This can be done with the following code (we'll first include the necessary imports):

```python
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3
from plotly.io import write_html # import interactive charts

# Creating the Database
# (1) read in the datasets
temps = pd.read_csv('temps_stacked.csv')
countries = pd.read_csv('countries.csv')
stations = pd.read_csv('station-metadata.csv')

# rename columns with spaces in their name
# -> remove the spaces
countries = countries.rename(columns = {'FIPS 10-4':'FIPS',
                                        'ISO 3166':'ISO'})

# (2) storing the datasets into a database (db)
# (a) establishing connection to temps.db
# will create temps.db file if it doesn' exist
conn = sqlite3.connect('temps.db')

# (b) populating the db
temps.to_sql("temperatures",conn,if_exists = "replace",index = False)
countries.to_sql("countries",conn,if_exists = "replace",index = False)
stations.to_sql("stations",conn,if_exists = "replace",index = False)

# (c) close connection
conn.close()
```

## Extracting data
Now that we have the database "temps.db," I will create a function called `query_climate_database()` that allows us to obtain a pandas dataframe with the temperature readings for the specified country, in a specified date range, for a specified month of the year.

This function accepts 4 arguments
- `country`, a string giving the name of a country (e.g. ‘South Korea’) for which data should be returned
- `year_begin` and `year_end`, two integers giving the earliest and latest years for which should be returned
- `month`, an integer giving the month of the year for which should be returned

The dataframe will have the following columns
- The station name.
- The latitude of the station.
- The longitude of the station.
- The name of the country in which the station is located.
- The year in which the reading was taken.
- The month in which the reading was taken.
- The average temperature at the specified station during the specified year and month. (Note: the temperatures in the raw data are already averages by month, so you don’t have to do any aggregation at this stage.)

Here is the function
```python
def query_climate_database(country, month, year_begin, year_end):
  # establish connection
  conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")

  # SQL command
  cmd = \
  f"""
  select S.name, S.latitude, S.longitude, C.Name Country,T.year,T.month, T.temp
  FROM temperatures T
  LEFT JOIN stations S
   ON T.ID = S.ID
  LEFT JOIN countries C
   ON SUBSTRING(T.ID,1,2) = C.FIPS
  WHERE (T.year BETWEEN {year_begin} AND {year_end})
   AND (T.month = {month})
   AND (Country = '{country}')
  """

  # return df and close connection to db
  df = pd.read_sql(cmd, conn)
  return df
  conn.close()
```

We'll test our function with the following input:
```python
df = query_climate_database(country = "India", year_begin = 1980,
                            year_end = 2020, month = 1)
```
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/df1-hw1.png)

### 3. Geographic Scatter Function for Yearly Temperature Increases
With the query function above, and some visualisation techniques in plotly express, we're going to answer the following question:
> How does the average yearly change in temperature vary within a given country?


We can visualise the answer to this question via a function called `temperature_coefficient_plot()` which accepts 5 explicit arguments and returns a figure showing how the the average yearly temperature within a specific month and within a specific country changes over time.

Information on function's arguments:
- `country`, `year_begin`, `year_end`, and `month` will be used in the same manner as in the `query_climate_database()` function
- `min_obs` is a new parameter that specifies the minimum required number of years of data for any given station to be considered

This function will return a plotly express figure.

```python
# begin with imports that are needed
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from plotly import express as px # import

def coef(data_group):
    """
    computes a linear regression of the Temp and Year
    variables and returns the slope coefficient which
    represents change in temperature every year

    Returns
    - lr.coef_[0]: slope coefficient of the regression
    """
    X = data_group[["Year"]] # as a Pandas object
    y = data_group["Temp"] # as an array
    lr = LinearRegression()

    # fit our linear regression model
    # and return slope coefficient
    lr.fit(X,y)
    return lr.coef_[0]

def temperature_coefficient_plot(country,year_begin,year_end, month, min_obs, **kwargs):
    """
    This function and its parameters are described above

    Returns
    - fig: a ploty express figure depicting the estimates of yearly increase
    in temperature in a specific month for certain stations in a country
    over a specified period of time (year_begin to year_end)
    """
    df = query_climate_database(country= country,
                                month = month,
                                year_begin = year_begin,
                                year_end = year_end)
    # filter dataframe for stations with at least min_obs samples
    filt_df = df[df.groupby(['NAME','Month'])['Temp'].transform('count') > min_obs]

    # compute the yearly change in temperature
    coefs = filt_df.groupby(['NAME','Month','LATITUDE','LONGITUDE']).apply(coef)
    coefs = coefs.reset_index()
    coefs.rename(columns = {0:'Estimated Yearly Increase (C˚)'},inplace = True)
    coefs['Estimated Yearly Increase (C˚)'] = \
    round(coefs['Estimated Yearly Increase (C˚)'],5)

    # dictionary of months
    month_d = {1:"January",2:'February',3:'March',
               4:"April",5:'May',6:'June',
               7:'July',8:'August',9:'September',
               10:'October',11:'November',12:'December'}

    fig = px.scatter_mapbox(coefs, # dataframe
                            lat = "LATITUDE", # latitude data
                            lon = "LONGITUDE", # longitude data
                            hover_name = "NAME", # show station name

                            # color data points by
                            color = "Estimated Yearly Increase (C˚)",
                            # center at 0
                            color_continuous_midpoint=0,

                            # zoom, mapbox_style, etc.
                            **kwargs,

                            # dynamic plot title
                            title = f'Estimates of yearly increase in temperature \
in {month_d[month]} for stations in {country}, years {year_begin} - {year_end}')

    # return plotly figure
    return fig
```

When we call this function with the following inputs, we get the following sample output:
```python
# set plotly express color map
color_map = px.colors.diverging.RdGy_r

# save figure in fig variable
fig = temperature_coefficient_plot("India", 1980, 2020, 1,
                                   min_obs = 10,

                                   # **kwargs
                                   zoom = 2,
                                   mapbox_style="carto-positron",
                                   color_continuous_scale=color_map)

fig
```
