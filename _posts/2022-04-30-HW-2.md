## Introduction
In this project, I create a web scraper that recommends movies or TV shows to users. A movie or TV show is recommended if a high number of actors in your current favorite movie or TV show also perform in it.

To demonstrate how my web scraper works, I will use my favourite movie as an example. My favorite movie is interstellar, which can be found here: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/

Here is the link to the web scraper project's repository: https://github.com/shannan-liu1/movie-recommender

## 1. Initialize your project
1. To begin, create a new GitHub repository on your local device if you would like to save your work to GitHub
2. Open a terminal in the location of your repository on your laptop, and type:
```python
scrapy startproject IMDB_scraper
cd IMDB_scraper
```

## 2. Write the web scraper
First, create a file inside the spiders directory called imdb_spider.py. Add the following lines to the py file:
```python
# to run
# scrapy crawl imdb_spider -o movies.csv

import scrapy

class ImdbSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'imdb_spider'

    start_urls = ['https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/']
```

for the `start_url` variable, customise the link to that of your favorite movie or TV show. The current link goes to the IMDB page for Interstellar.

Once you're done with changing the link as you see fit, we can now implement the following methods in our ImdbSpider class to make the web scraper work.

### Web scraper methods
```python
def parse(self,response):
  """
  assumes we start on a movie page, then
  navigates to "All Cast & Crew" page
  and calls parse_full_credits() on that page
  """
  next_page = f"{response.url}fullcredits/"
  #print(next_page)
  #next_page = response.urljoin(next_page)
  yield scrapy.Request(next_page, callback=self.parse_full_credits)
```
Our web scraper will begin on the IMDB page of our favorite movie/TV show. The `parse()` method created with the code show above will take us from this starting page to the All Cast & Crew page, which contains links to the IMDB pages of all of the actors who performed in the movie/TV show.

Once on the All Cast & Crew page, we execute the method `parse_full_credits()`, shown below:
```python
def parse_full_credits(self, response):
  """
  assume we are on the All Cast & Crew page
  get links to all cast member's IMDB pages and then
  call parse_actor_page() on those pages
  """
  # get links for each actor's imdb page
  links = [a.attrib["href"] for a in response.css("td.primary_photo a")]

  # go through each actor's link and run the function "parse_actor_page"
  for link in links:
      yield scrapy.Request(f'https://www.imdb.com/{link}',
                          callback = self.parse_actor_page)
```

This method will collect the links to each actor's individual IMDB page. Then it will take us to each actor's IMDB page, on which we will execute the `parse_actor_page()` method.

```python
def parse_actor_page(self, response):
      """
      assumes you're on actor's IMDB page
      will yield the actor's name and all
      of the movies or TV shows they've done
      """

      # get actor's name
      actor = response.css("td h1.header span.itemprop::text").get()
      # get all the movies and tv shows they've worked on
      movies_and_shows = response.css("div.filmo-row b a::text").getall()

      # create a dictionary for each of the movies
      # and shows that actors have worked on
      for i in movies_and_shows:
          yield {"actor" : actor,
          "movie_or_TV_name" : i}
```

Each actor's IMBD page has a list all of the movies and TV shows that they have acted in or will be acting in. The `parse_actor_page()` collects all of that information and stores it in a csv file for us.


## How to use the web scraper
Once you've implemented the functions above, open terminal and go to the directory where your scraper is saved. Then enter `scrapy crawl imdb_spider -o results.csv` In other words:
```
cd IMDB_scraper
scrapy crawl imdb_spider -o movies.csv
```

This will execute the web scraper and return a csv file called `results.csv` which has with columns for actor names and the movies and TV shows on which they worked.

After that, you can run the following code in a jupyter notebook to get movie recommendations based on
```python
import pandas as pd

# read our csv with actor names and movies/TV shows they've worked on
df = pd.read_csv('../IMDB_scraper/results.csv')

# rename columns for aesthetics
df.rename(columns = {'movie_or_TV_name':'Movie or TV Show','actor':'Actor'},inplace = True)

# get a sorted list with the top movie/TV shows
# that share actors with your favorite movie/TV show
# note: will only show the top 15 results
final_df = pd.DataFrame(df.groupby(['Movie or TV Show'])['Actor'].aggregate(
'count')).sort_values(by='Actor',ascending = False)[:15]

print(final_df.to_markdown())
```

Here is the output for the movie Interstellar:
