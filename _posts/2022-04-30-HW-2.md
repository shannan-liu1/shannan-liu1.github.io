## Introduction
In this project, I create a web scraper that recommends movies or TV shows to you. A movie or TV show is recommended if a high number of actors in your current favorite movie or TV show also perform in it.

To demonstrate how my web scraper works, I will use my favourite movie as an example. My favorite movie is interstellar, which can be found here: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/

Here is the link to my project repository: https://github.com/shannan-liu1/movie-recommender

## Project set up
### Implementation of Parse
```python
def parse(self,response):
      """
      assumes we start on a movie page, then
      navigates to "All Cast & Crew" page
      """
      next_page = f"{response.url}fullcredits/"
      #print(next_page)
      #next_page = response.urljoin(next_page)
      yield scrapy.Request(next_page, callback=self.parse_full_credits)
```
